# win95-web
An implementation of Microsoft's Windows 95 on the web.<br>
This project is available on my website over at https://hallo89.net/win95/! As I've recently integrated light PHP in order to make the whole project more dynamic and flexible, it can't be shown standalone on GitHub Pages anymore.

The early file history is not available since I only moved this project to Git as its scale grew larger.

Please note that I am not affiliated with Microsoft or its Windows 95 product in any way - this is just a hobby project for fun.
